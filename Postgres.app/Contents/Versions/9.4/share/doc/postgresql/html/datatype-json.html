  data, as specified in <A
HREF="http://rfc7159.net/rfc7159"
TARGET="_top"
>RFC
  7159</A
>. Such data can also be stored as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

  the JSON data types have the advantage of enforcing that each
  stored value is valid according to the JSON rules.  There are also
  assorted JSON-specific functions and operators available for data stored
  in these data types; see <A
HREF="functions-json.html"

  input.  The major practical difference is one of efficiency.  The
  <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>json</TT

  which processing functions must reparse on each execution; while
  <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>jsonb</TT

  makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion
  overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing
  is needed.  <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

  significant advantage.
 </P
><P
>  Because the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>json</TT

  will preserve semantically-insignificant white space between tokens, as
  well as the order of keys within JSON objects. Also, if a JSON object
  within the value contains the same key more than once, all the key/value
  pairs are kept.  (The processing functions consider the last value as the
  operative one.)  By contrast, <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>jsonb</TT
> does not preserve white
  space, does not preserve the order of object keys, and does not keep
  duplicate object keys.  If duplicate keys are specified in the input,
  only the last value is kept.
 </P
><P
>  In general, most applications should prefer to store JSON data as
  <TT

  legacy assumptions about ordering of object keys.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

  encoding per database.  It is therefore not possible for the JSON
  types to conform rigidly to the JSON specification unless the database
  encoding is UTF8. Attempts to directly include characters that
  cannot be represented in the database encoding will fail; conversely,
  characters that can be represented in the database encoding but not
  in UTF8 will be allowed.

  function for the <TT

  regardless of the database encoding, and are checked only for syntactic
  correctness (that is, that four hex digits follow <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

  However, the input function for <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

  Unicode escapes for non-ASCII characters (those
  above <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U+007F</TT

  insists that any use of Unicode surrogate pairs to designate characters
  outside the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane be correct.  Valid Unicode
  escapes, except for <TT

   the traditional relational data model, which is compelling in

   for both approaches to co-exist and complement each other within
   the same application.  However, even for applications where maximal
   flexibility is desired, it is still recommended that JSON documents
   have a somewhat fixed structure.  The structure is typically
   unenforced (though enforcing some business rules declaratively is
   possible), but having a predictable structure makes it easier to write

   Although storing large documents is practicable, keep in mind that
   any update acquires a row-level lock on the whole row.
   Consider limiting JSON documents to a
   manageable size in order to decrease lock contention among updating
   transactions.  Ideally, JSON documents should each
   represent an atomic datum that business rules dictate cannot
   reasonably be further subdivided into smaller datums that
   could be modified independently.

    If a GIN index is created on this column,

SELECT jdoc-&gt;'guid', jdoc-&gt;'name' FROM api WHERE jdoc @&gt; '{"company": "Magnafone"}';</PRE

    following, because though the operator <TT

    it is not applied directly to the indexed column <TT

</P><PRE

    Still, with appropriate use of expression indexes, the above
    query can use an index.  If querying for particular items within
    the <TT

    may be worthwhile:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    Now, the <TT

    (More information on expression indexes can be found in <A

  </P

SELECT jdoc-&gt;'guid', jdoc-&gt;'name' FROM api WHERE jdoc @&gt; '{"tags": ["qui"]}';</PRE
><P>
    A simple GIN index on the <TT

>jdoc</TT

    query.  But note that such an index will store copies of every key and
    value in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>jdoc</TT
> column, whereas the expression index
    of the previous example stores only data found under
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tags</TT

    flexible (since it supports queries about any key), targeted expression
    indexes are likely to be smaller and faster to search than a simple
    index.

    Basically, each <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> index item is
    a hash of the value and the key(s) leading to it; for example to index
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}</TT
>, a single index item would
    be created incorporating all three of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>bar</TT
>,
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baz</TT
> into the hash value.  Thus a containment query
    looking for this structure would result in an extremely specific index
    search; but there is no way at all to find out whether <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>
    appears as a key.  On the other hand, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_ops</TT
>
    index would create three index items representing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>bar</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baz</TT
> separately; then to do the
    containment query, it would look for rows containing all three of
    these items.  While GIN indexes can perform such an AND search fairly
    efficiently, it will still be less specific and slower than the
    equivalent <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> search, especially if
    there are a very large number of rows containing any single one of the
    three index items.
  </P
><P
>    A disadvantage of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> approach is
    that it produces no index entries for JSON structures not containing
    any values, such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{"a": {}}</TT
>.  If a search for
    documents containing such a structure is requested, it will require a
    full-index scan, which is quite slow.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> is
    therefore ill-suited for applications that often perform such searches.

CLASS="TYPE"

    indexes.  These are usually useful only if it's important to check
    equality of complete JSON documents.

      Objects with equal numbers of pairs are compared in the order:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>key-1</I

      Note that object keys are compared in their storage order;
      in particular, since shorter keys are stored before longer keys, this
      can lead to results that might be unintuitive, such as:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>{ "aa": 1, "c": 1} &#62; {"b": 1, "d": 1}</PRE
><P>
      Similarly, arrays with equal numbers of elements are compared in the
      order:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>element-1</I
></TT

CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I

      Primitive JSON values are compared using the same
      comparison rules as for the underlying
      <SPAN

>PostgreSQL</SPAN

      compared using the default database collation.
