>    However, several of the issues corrected in this release could have
    resulted in corruption of foreign-key constraints; that is, there
    might now be referencing rows for which there is no matching row in
    the referenced table.  It may be worthwhile to recheck such
    constraints after installing this update.  The simplest way to do that
    is to drop and recreate each suspect constraint; however, that will
    require taking an exclusive lock on both tables, so it is unlikely to
    be acceptable in production databases.  Alternatively, you can do a
    manual join query between the two tables to look for unmatched rows.

      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed

      freezing parameters were used for multixact IDs too; but since
      the consumption rates of transaction IDs and multixact IDs can be

      lock wouldn't get checked, thus possibly allowing B to complete when
      it shouldn't.  This case is new in 9.3 since prior versions did not
      have any types of row locking that would permit another transaction
      to update the row at all.
