>    On systems lacking Unix-domain sockets, notably Windows, this test method
    starts a temporary server configured to accept any connection originating
    on the local machine.  Any local user can gain database superuser
    privileges when connecting to this server, and could in principle exploit
    all privileges of the operating-system user running the tests.  Therefore,
    it is not recommended that you use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make check</TT
> on an affected
    system shared with untrusted users.  Instead, run the tests after
    completing the installation, as described in the next section.

>    Because this test method runs a temporary server, it will not work
    if you did the build as the root user, since the server will not start as
    root.  Recommended procedure is not to do the build as root, or else to
    perform testing after completing the installation.

CLASS="LITERAL"
>make check</TT
>
    before installing the new version, you might find that the tests fail
    because the new programs try to use the already-installed shared
    libraries.  (Typical symptoms are complaints about undefined symbols.)
    If you wish to run the tests before overwriting the old installation,
    you'll need to build with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>configure --disable-rpath</TT
>.
    It is not recommended that you use this option for the final installation,
    however.

>    The parallel regression test starts quite a few processes under your
    user ID.  Presently, the maximum concurrency is twenty parallel test
    scripts, which means forty processes: there's a server process and a
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> process for each test script.
    So if your system enforces a per-user limit on the number of processes,
    make sure this limit is at least fifty or so, else you might get
    random-seeming failures in the parallel test.  If you are not in
    a position to raise the limit, you can cut down the degree of parallelism
    by setting the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>MAX_CONNECTIONS</TT
> parameter.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>make MAX_CONNECTIONS=10 check</PRE

make installcheck-world</PRE

CLASS="LITERAL"
>make installcheck</TT
>.  Other
   considerations are the same as previously explained for each method.
   Note that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make check-world</TT
> builds a separate temporary
   installation tree for each tested module, so it requires a great deal
   more time and disk space than <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make installcheck-world</TT

  </P

   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make check</TT

>make installcheck</TT

   subdirectory of the build tree.  Keep in mind that <TT

    locale defined in the current environment and the corresponding
    database encoding as determined by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    can be useful to test different locales by setting the appropriate
    environment variables, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>make check LANG=C
make check LC_COLLATE=en_US.utf8 LC_CTYPE=fr_CA.utf8</PRE
><P>
    For implementation reasons, setting <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_ALL</TT
> does not
    work for this purpose; all the other locale-related environment
    variables do work.
   </P
><P
>    When testing against an existing installation, the locale is
    determined by the existing database cluster and cannot be set
    separately for the test run.
   </P
><P

</P><PRE

    Setting the database encoding this way typically only makes sense
    if the locale is C; otherwise the encoding is chosen automatically
    from the locale, and specifying an encoding that does not match
    the locale will result in an error.
   </P

    an existing installation, though in the latter case it must be

>30.1.6. Testing Hot Standby</A

>   The source distribution also contains regression tests for the static
   behavior of Hot Standby. These tests require a running primary server
   and a running standby server that is accepting new WAL changes from the
   primary (using either file-based log shipping or streaming replication).
   Those servers are not automatically created for you, nor is replication
   setup documented here. Please check the various sections of the
   documentation devoted to the required commands and related issues.
  </P
><P
>   To run the Hot Standby tests, first create a database
   called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>regression</TT
> on the primary:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>psql -h primary -c "CREATE DATABASE regression"</PRE
><P>
   Next, run the preparatory script
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/test/regress/sql/hs_primary_setup.sql</TT
>
   on the primary in the regression database, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>psql -h primary -f src/test/regress/sql/hs_primary_setup.sql regression</PRE
><P>
   Allow these changes to propagate to the standby.
  </P
><P
>   Now arrange for the default database connection to be to the standby
   server under test (for example, by setting the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGHOST</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGPORT</TT
> environment variables).
   Finally, run <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make standbycheck</TT
> in the regression directory:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>cd src/test/regress
make standbycheck</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   Some extreme behaviors can also be generated on the primary using the
   script <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/test/regress/sql/hs_primary_extremes.sql</TT
>
   to allow the behavior of the standby to be tested.
